# Bull Cow Game!

Bull Cow Game is set in a 3D world. You have a sign post which you can type into. Once in the game press TAB to use the terminal. 

The basic idea is you need to guess the word. The word will be an "Isogram" an Isogram is a word that does not have repeating letters. The game will let you know how many letters the word is. You start with a number of lives to figure out the word. Feel free to download the game, have a go and let me know what you think! 

If you want to cheat, have a look in the 'BullCowCartridge.cpp' file and you may find a line of code you can uncomment to display the word! (Let's not make cheating tooooo easy!).

I learnt about creating this game by following a C++ and Unreal Engine course on Udemy. If your interested in having a go at the course yourself, check it out here: https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/

Big thanks to the guys at GameDev.TV Team for having such an informative course!

The game is created using the Unreal Engine and C++, the functionality of the terminal has been coded using C++ while the 3D aspects are done using the Unreal engine, such as asset placement, lighting, terrain and map generation. For the purposes of this project, I created the C++ code that make the terminal or sign post function. I did move a few things around in the scene and play with some of the unreal engine aspects, but the main point of this project was more to do with learning C++ and implementing things such as loops, functions, arrays and other useful forms of C++ coding!
