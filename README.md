# Bull Cow Game!

Bull Cow Game is set in a 3D world. You have a sign post which you can type into. 

The basic idea is you need to guess the word. The word will be an "Isogram" an Isogram is a word that does not have repeating letters. The game will let you know how many letters the word is. You start with a number of lives to figure out the word. Feel free to download the game, have a go and let me know what you think! 

To run the game: Simply download the repo and load it up in Unreal!

If you want to cheat, have a look in the 'BullCowCartridge.cpp' file and you may find a line of code you can uncomment to display the word! (Let's not make cheating tooooo easy!).

The game is created using the Unreal Engine and C++, the functionality of the terminal has been coded using C++ while the 3D aspects are done using the Unreal engine, such as asset placement, lighting, terrain and map generation. For the purposes of this project, I created the C++ code that make the terminal or sign post function. I did move a few things around in the scene and play with some of the unreal engine aspects, but the main point of this project was more to do with learning C++ and implementing things such as loops, functions, arrays and other useful forms of C++ coding!

## Controls

Once in the game press TAB to use the terminal and type in your guesses!
